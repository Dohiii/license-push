# support-license-tool
This tool will allow clients to push a license file to pod.

## Roadmap:
1. Command line tool that works with one pod at a time.
2. GUI tool that works with multiple pods at a time.

### Usage:
`--ip [i.p.addr.ess]` - Required parameter. Used to specify the IP address of the pod.
